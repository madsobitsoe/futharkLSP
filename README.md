Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel programming language.
Its optimising compiler is able to compile it to typically very
performant GPU code.  The language and compiler is developed at
[DIKU](http://diku.dk) at the University of Copenhagen, originally as
part of the [HIPERFIT centre](http://hiperfit.dk).  The language and
compiler is quite stable, and suitable for practical programming.

For more information, see [the website](http://futhark-lang.org).

Also see the [compiler and language
documentation](http://futhark.readthedocs.io) and the [basis library
documentation](https://futhark-lang.org/docs).

Usage
=====

To compile a Futhark program to sequential C:

    futhark c prog.fut -o prog

Or maybe OpenCL:

    futhark opencl prog.fut -o prog

And then run it:

    ./prog < prog.input

To interpret a Futhark program:

    futhark run prog.fut < prog.input

Hacking
=======

We try to make use of Github issues for organising our work.  Issues
tagged with
[good first issue](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
do not require deep knowledge of the code base.

Testing
=======

Run `futhark test tests` to check how well we're doing.  Use `futhark
test -t` if you're in a hurry and only want to check that all the
tests type-check.
