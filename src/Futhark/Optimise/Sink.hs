-- | "Sinking" is conceptually the opposite of hoisting.  The idea is
-- to take code that looks like this:
--
-- @
-- x = xs[i]
-- y = ys[i]
-- if x != 0 then {
--   y
-- } else {
--   0
-- }
-- @
--
-- and turn it into
--
-- @
-- x = xs[i]
-- if x != 0 then {
--   y = ys[i]
--   y
-- } else {
--   0
-- }
-- @
--
-- The idea is to delay loads from memory until (if) they are actually
-- needed.  Code patterns like the above is particularly common in
-- code that makes use of pattern matching on sum types.
--
-- We are currently quite conservative about when we do this.  In
-- particular, if any consumption is going on in a body, we don't do
-- anything.  This is far too conservative.  Also, we are careful
-- never to duplicate work.
--
-- This pass redundantly computes free-variable information a lot.  If
-- you ever see this pass as being a compilation speed bottleneck,
-- start by caching that a bit.
--
-- This pass is defined on the Kernels representation.  This is not
-- because we do anything kernel-specific here, but simply because
-- more explicit indexing is going on after SOACs are gone.
